# Abstract
A structure-preserving kernel ridge regression method is presented that allows the recovery of
globally defined, potentially high-dimensional, and nonlinear Hamiltonian functions on Poisson man-
ifolds out of datasets made of noisy observations of Hamiltonian vector fields. The proposed method
is based on finding the solution of a non-standard kernel ridge regression where the observed data is
generated as the noisy image by a vector bundle map of the differential of the function that one is
trying to estimate. Additionally, it is shown how a suitable regularization solves the intrinsic non-
identifiability of the learning problem due to the degeneracy of the Poisson tensor and the presence of
Casimir functions. A full error analysis is conducted that provides convergence rates using fixed and
adaptive regularization parameters. The good performance of the proposed estimator is illustrated
with several numerical experiments.

Enjoy! :)
